# mixxx-traktor-kontrol-custom-mapping

edits to the default kontrol-s2 map to suit my workflow. 

changes so far:

- pressing loop encoder while in a loop opens the loop
- shift + jog wheel is fast seek

planned changes:

- effect buttons [1,2,3,4] toggle effect busses and filter knob changes amount (more like how traktor does effects)
